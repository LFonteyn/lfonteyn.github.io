Large language models like BERT can be pre-trained from scratch on a specific textual domain and achieve strong performance on a series of downstream tasks. However, this is a costly endeavour, both in terms of the computational resources as well as the substantial amounts of training data it requires. An appealing alternative, then, is to employ existing \u2018general purpose\u2019 models (pre-trained on present-day language) and subsequently adapt them to a specific domain by further pre-training. Focusing on the domain of historical text in English, this paper demonstrates that pre-training on domain-specific (i.e. historical) data from scratch yields a generally stronger background model than adapting a present-day language model.

Due to its narrower scope, case-driven research is more restricted in terms of the data it may employ, and at the same time it requires a more fine-grained description of the targeted linguistic developments.

We deploy hierarchical clustering algorithms over distributed meaning representations in order to capture the evolution of the semantic space of verbs that collocate with to death. We then describe the arising diachronic processes by means of monotonic effects, providing a more accurate picture than customary linear regression models.

Drawing on insight from literary theory, theoretical linguistics, and cultural evolution theory, we argue that changes in the cultural entrenchment of fairy tales and folk stories are re\ufb02ected in (small) structural \u2018mutations\u2019 in the story. More speci\ufb01cally, we aim to show that with the increasing familiarity of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d, its story frame and characters have gradually become part of the author and audience\u2019s shared world knowledge, which is encoded in the type of linguistic devices used to introduce the characters. To this end, we performed a Bayesian logistic regression analysis on a diachronic collection (late 18th century\u20132015) of the world\u2019s most iconic fairy tale, using automatically generated time estimations for a subset of undated reproductions in the story lineage, and including these estimates and approximated measurement errors in the statistical model. Results show that there is indeed a marked increase of linguistic markers that indicate that the characters are already known or \u201caccessible\u201d to the audience. This development re\ufb02ects the author\u2019s changing intuitions and beliefs about the familiarity of the story, and, indirectly, the changing expectations of the story\u2019s audience regarding the appearance of certain characters in the story frame. Notably, this study is the \ufb01rst to quantitatively describe the diachronic development of a story (and the concepts associated with it) into the realm of \u2018shared knowledge\u2019, showing that it is a slow and gradual process.

This leads to the expectation that over time only one form can survive (substitution) or each form must find its unique niche in functional space (differentiation). However, competition cannot easily explain what causes functional overlap or how form-function mappings will be reorganized. It is argued here that the changes which competing forms undergo are steered by various analogical forces. As a result of analogy, competing forms often show attraction, becoming functionally more (instead of less) alike. Attraction can maintain and increase functional overlap in language. At the same time, competing forms are analogically anchored to a broader constructional network. Cases of differentiation typically follow from the relations in that network. Evidence is drawn from the literature and from three corpusbased case studies, addressing attraction and differentiation in English aspectual constructions, English secondary predicate constructions, and in a pair of Dutch degree modifiers. Evidence is provided of a phenomenon competitionbased accounts could not predict (attraction), and a solution is offered for one they could not very well explain (differentiation).

While the formal differences between NGs and VGs are well documented, their semantics remains largely unexplored territory. The perspective that is taken here is centered on the linguistic notion of reference and various aspects of the conceptualization involved in it. As they formally hover between more nominal and more clauselike internal properties, gerunds form an interesting test case for the cognitive perspective on referentiality. Our corpus analysis describes how the situations that NGs and VGs refer to are conceptualized as deictic expressions grounded in the speech event in Present-day English, and how this has changed since the Early Modern period. It is shown that only a multi-layered model of referentiality can account for the subtle differences found between NGs and VGs: while no fundamental shifts are found with regard to the traditional referential subtypes (specific, non-specific, generic), NGs and VGs do turn out to differ in their choice for either nominal or clausal grounding mechanisms, in their status as existentially stable or flexible entities and in the mental spaces in which they situate the events that they conceptualize.", "ISSN": "0936-5907, 1613-3641", "volume": "26", "source": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "issued": {"date-parts": [["2015", 1, 1]]}, "author": [{"given": "Lauren", "family": "Fonteyn"}, {"given": "Liesbet", "family": "Heyvaert"}, {"given": "Charlotte", "family": "Maekelberghe"}], "container-title": "Cognitive Linguistics", "title-short": "How do gerunds conceptualize events?", "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2020", 1, 26]]}, "type": "article-journal", "id": "http://zotero.org/users/6306336/items/3346IJYF"}, {"DOI": "10.1177/0075424214564365", "license": "All rights reserved", "language": "en", "title": "What It Means to Verbalize: The Changing Discourse Functions of the English Gerund", "URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0075424214564365", "issue": "1", "abstract": "The English gerund system consists of two types of gerunds: a nominal gerund (the learning of a language), and a verbal gerund that developed out of the nominal gerund (learning a language). While the formal aspects of this diachronic verbalization of the gerund are well documented, much remains to be said about the discoursefunctional side of the change. In this paper, it is argued that the formal verbalization of the gerund is accompanied by an important change in the discourse-functional organization of the gerund system. Based on functional characterizations of noun phrase (NP) behavior in the literature, the prototypical behavior of complex NPs is operationalized as (i) functioning as manipulable discourse participants that are important enough in the following discourse to be susceptible to anaphoric targeting and (ii) being inaccessible to anaphoric targeting of internal participants. The results of an analysis of a set of nominal gerunds, verbal gerunds and \u2018regular\u2019 complex NPs covering the period 1640\u20131914 (taken from the Penn Parsed Corpora of Early Modern and Modern British English) shows that the increasingly clause-like appearance of the verbal gerund is in fact accompanied by atypical NP behavior. Moreover, the paper makes clear that the changes in the discourse-functional organization of the gerund system did not only affect the verbal gerund, but also had some implications for the nominal gerund.
